<h2>How it works</h2>

The game is a metaphoric example of obtaining permit.
If you know <b>Asterix</b>, you might more or less know what to do, but if you don't, here you go:
<ul>
<li>the game can be closed by pressing the 'x' key on your keyboard</li>
<li>the player is symbolized by 'Â§' and can be moved by pressing the arrow keys.</li>
<li>immovable objects are marked as '#', '|' or '[ . ]'</li>
<li>you can move up or down stairs. They are marked as <b>'X' for up/down, '^' for up and 'v' for down</b></li>
<li>a counter is symbolized as '[ (Â°: ]'</li>
<li>you can interact with a counter if you stand right next to it</li>
<li>the counter then tells you to get another form at counter "X" to move on</li>
<li>the counter identification-number is displayed as follows: <b>[3:a]</b> -> <em>3</em> represents third-floor and <em>a</em> represents the left/rignt counter of said floor. (a: left / b: right)</li>
<li>this is of course a simplification of the original cartoon, but i had to change it up a bit to make it more playable</li>
<li>the <b>goal</b> of the game is of course to obtain "Passport A38"</li>
</ul>
